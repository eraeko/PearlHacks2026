# Inspiration
Financial literacy often feels intimdidating, especially for students and young adults as they start making financial decisions. We wanted to make learning abot credit scores, loans, and financial decision making fun and interactive! What is managing credit felt like running a bakery? That's how Dough & Dough was born, a game where financial decisions directly imapct bussiness growth.

# What It Does
Dough & Dough is an interactive browser-based game where players:
- Bake bakery items (muffins, cakes, croissiants)
- Manage ingredient inventory
- Earn revenue from sales
- Make decisions about using cash vs credit
- Take out and repay loans
- Watch their credit score impact business growth

Core Mechanics
- Buying ingredients with cash improves credit
- Using supplier credit lowers credit
- Loan interest rates depend on credit score

- Higher credit = faster business growth multiplier

The game visually demonstrates how financial behavior impacts long-term success.
